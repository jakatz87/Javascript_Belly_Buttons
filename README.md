## Overview
Given a JSON file of samples from a study on bacteria found in belly buttons, I created an interactive web dashboard using Javascript and HTML.

## Resources
*Data Source*: 
- samples.json

*Software*:
- Javascript
- HTML, CSS
- d3
- APIs
- VS Code

## Results
Using the HTML in the `index.html` file as a structure for the site, the `charts.js` file was created for interactivity and user experience.  I created a drop-down menu with the default sample and accompanying bar graph, gauge chart, and bubble chart.

When a user selects a different sample number, the appropriate demographics and visualizations are displayed so users can see relevant information about the bacterial make-up and health of their belly buttons.
